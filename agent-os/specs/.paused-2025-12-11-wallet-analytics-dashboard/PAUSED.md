# ⏸️ PAUSED - Wallet Analytics Dashboard

**Status**: Paused pending MVP completion
**Date Paused**: 2025-12-11
**Reason**: Strategic pivot to Cliente-First MVP approach

## Context

This spec was created for Phase 1 of the original roadmap. After gap analysis, the team decided to prioritize the complete customer-business transaction loop (Phase 0 MVP) before enhancing wallet features.

## What Was Completed

✅ Spec shaping with comprehensive requirements gathering
✅ Full specification document (`spec.md`)
✅ Detailed tasks breakdown (`tasks.md`)
✅ Technical architecture defined (Recharts, analytics API, caching strategy)

## When to Resume

Resume this spec **after Phase 0 (MVP Foundation)** is complete:
- ✅ Cliente QR scanning (earn points)
- ✅ Cliente redemption flow
- ✅ Business QR generation
- ✅ PWA mobile-optimized wallet
- ✅ Basic gamification visuals (tier badges)

## Next Steps When Resuming

1. Review spec.md for any changes needed based on MVP learnings
2. Verify analytics API endpoints align with final transaction structure
3. Run `/implement-tasks` or `/orchestrate-tasks` to begin implementation
