# Point Expiration Notifications - Raw Idea

**Feature Name:** Point Expiration Notifications

**Description:**
Implement user notifications (email/SMS) for upcoming point expirations with configurable warning periods. This feature will:
- Notify users before their points expire (e.g., 7 days, 3 days, 1 day before)
- Support multiple notification channels (email, SMS)
- Allow users to configure notification preferences
- Include summary of points expiring and suggested actions
- Integrate with existing transaction and ledger system
- Effort estimate: M (1 week)

**Context from Roadmap:**
This is item #2 in Phase 1 - Enhanced Wallet Experience. It builds on the existing:
- Transaction engine (EARN/REDEEM/ADJUSTMENT/BURN)
- Point ledger system
- Background worker system (BullMQ/Redis)
- User management system

**Date Initiated:** 2025-11-18
