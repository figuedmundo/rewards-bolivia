### Step 1.5: Design User Flow
**AI Instructions**: Map out the complete user journey.

#### User Flow Template:
```markdown
### User Flow: Job Matching

#### Happy Path
```
1. User lands on Dashboard
   ↓
2. Sees "AI Job Matches" card with badge showing "15 new matches"
   ↓
3. Clicks "View Matches"
   ↓
4. Navigates to /job-matches page
   ↓
5. Sees list of matched jobs sorted by relevance
   ↓
6. Can filter by location, salary, job type
   ↓
7. Clicks on a job to see details
   ↓
8. Sees match explanation with matched skills highlighted
   ↓
9. Can save job to favorites or apply directly
   ↓
10. Can provide feedback (thumbs up/down) on match quality
```

#### Alternative Paths

**Path A: No Resume**
```
1. User visits job matches page
   ↓
2. Sees empty state: "Upload your resume to get AI-powered job matches"
   ↓
3. Clicks "Upload Resume" button
   ↓
4. Taken to resume upload flow
   ↓
5. After upload, redirected back to job matches
   ↓
6. Sees loading state while matches are generated
   ↓
7. Matches appear within 30 seconds
```

**Path B: No Matches Found**
```
1. User with resume visits job matches
   ↓
2. Sees message: "No matches found with current criteria"
   ↓
3. Suggested actions:
   - Adjust filters (lower min score, expand locations)
   - Update resume with more skills
   - Check back tomorrow for new postings
```

#### Error Paths

**Path E1: Matching Service Down**
```
1. User tries to refresh matches
   ↓
2. API returns 503 Service Unavailable
   ↓
3. Shows error message with retry button
   ↓
4. User can view cached matches (if available)
```

### Wireframes/Mockups
**Location**: [Link to Figma/Sketch/etc. or describe]

**Key Screens**:
1. Dashboard widget
2. Job Matches list page
3. Job detail with match explanation
4. Empty states
5. Loading states
6. Error states
```

---

### Step 2.2: Technical Decisions
**AI Instructions**: Document key technical choices.

#### Decision Template:

### Technical Decision 1: Matching Algorithm

**Decision**: Use hybrid approach combining keyword matching and semantic similarity

**Options Considered**:
1. **Keyword Matching Only**
   - Pros: Fast, simple, predictable
   - Cons: Misses semantic similarities, brittle

2. **Pure ML/AI Matching**
   - Pros: Intelligent, captures semantics
   - Cons: Slower, requires training data, less explainable

3. **Hybrid Approach** ← CHOSEN
   - Pros: Best of both worlds, explainable, tunable
   - Cons: More complex implementation

**Rationale**:
- Need explainability for user trust
- Want semantic understanding for better matches
- Performance requirements met with caching
- Can tune weights based on feedback

**Implementation**:
```python
def calculate_match_score(resume, job):
    # 40% weight: Keyword matching (fast, explainable)
    keyword_score = match_keywords(resume.skills, job.required_skills)
    
    # 40% weight: Semantic similarity (intelligent matching)
    semantic_score = calculate_semantic_similarity(
        resume.embedding, 
        job.embedding
    )
    
    # 20% weight: Experience and other factors
    experience_score = match_experience(resume, job)
    
    # Weighted average
    final_score = (
        keyword_score * 0.4 + 
        semantic_score * 0.4 + 
        experience_score * 0.2
    )
    
    return final_score, {
        'keyword': keyword_score,
        'semantic': semantic_score,
        'experience': experience_score
    }
```

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- More complex than simple keyword matching
- Requires embeddings infrastructure
- Worth it for quality improvements

---

### Technical Decision 2: Real-time vs Batch Processing

**Decision**: Use batch processing with Redis caching for UI reads

**Options Considered**:
1. **Real-time Matching**: Calculate on every request
2. **Batch Processing**: Pre-calculate matches daily ← CHOSEN
3. **Hybrid**: Cache + on-demand refresh

**Rationale**:
- Matching is computationally expensive
- Job postings don't change that frequently
- Users can wait for daily updates
- Can add manual refresh for power users

**Implementation**:
- Celery job runs daily at 2 AM
- Processes all active users
- Stores results in database
- Redis caches top 20 matches per user
- TTL of 24 hours

### Step 2.3: Data Flow Design
**AI Instructions**: Map how data moves through the system.

#### Data Flow Diagram:

### Data Flow: Job Matching

#### Flow 1: Initial Match Generation
```
User uploads resume
    ↓
Resume stored in database
    ↓
Resume parsing service extracts text
    ↓
OpenAI API generates embeddings
    ↓
Embeddings stored in vector database
    ↓
Matching job scheduled (Celery)
    ↓
Celery worker picks up task
    ↓
For each active job posting:
    - Calculate keyword match score
    - Calculate semantic similarity
    - Calculate experience match
    - Compute final score
    ↓
Filter matches (score > 70)
    ↓
Store top 100 matches in database
    ↓
Cache top 20 in Redis
    ↓
Send notification to user
```

#### Flow 2: Viewing Matches
```
User navigates to /job-matches
    ↓
Frontend calls GET /api/v1/job-matches
    ↓
Backend checks Redis cache
    ↓
If cache hit:
    Return cached matches (fast path)
Else:
    Query database
    ↓
    Cache results in Redis
    ↓
    Return to frontend
    ↓
Frontend renders match cards
```

#### Flow 3: Feedback Loop
```
User gives feedback (thumbs up/down)
    ↓
Frontend sends POST /api/v1/job-matches/{id}/feedback
    ↓
Backend stores feedback
    ↓
Async job analyzes feedback patterns
    ↓
Adjusts matching algorithm weights
    ↓
Improves future matches
```

### Step 3.3: Risk Assessment
**AI Instructions**: Identify and plan for risks.

#### Risk Matrix:
```markdown
### Feature Risks

#### Risk 1: OpenAI API Rate Limiting
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: High
**Category**: Technical

**Description**: OpenAI API has rate limits that could slow down embedding generation

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. Implement request batching (50 resumes per batch)
2. Add exponential backoff retry logic
3. Cache embeddings aggressively
4. Consider alternative embedding services as backup
5. Monitor usage and upgrade plan if needed

**Contingency Plan**:
- Fallback to keyword-only matching if API unavailable
- Queue requests and process when rate limit resets
- Notify users of delay with estimated time

---

#### Risk 2: Poor Match Quality
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: High
**Category**: Product

**Description**: Users might find matches irrelevant, leading to low engagement

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. Start with conservative matching (higher threshold)
2. Implement feedback loop early
3. A/B test different algorithms
4. Provide clear match explanations
5. Allow manual refresh if unsatisfied

**Contingency Plan**:
- Quick iteration on algorithm based on feedback
- Add manual job search as alternative
- Provide filters to refine results
- Consider human-in-the-loop for initial matches

---

#### Risk 3: Performance Issues with Scale
**Likelihood**: Low
**Impact**: High
**Category**: Technical

**Description**: Matching algorithm might be too slow with thousands of users

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. Batch processing instead of real-time
2. Optimize database queries with indexes
3. Use Redis caching extensively
4. Limit matches per user (top 100)
5. Load test with realistic data volumes

**Contingency Plan**:
- Scale horizontally with more workers
- Optimize algorithm (remove expensive operations)
- Reduce matching frequency (weekly instead of daily)
- Prioritize active users

**Backend Unit Tests**:
- [ ] JobMatchService.calculate_match_score()
- [ ] JobMatchService.generate_matches_for_user()
- [ ] ResumeParsingService.extract_skills()
- [ ] EmbeddingService.generate_embedding()
- [ ] Matching utility functions
- [ ] Model validation methods
- [ ] Schema validation

**Frontend Unit Tests**:
- [ ] JobMatchCard renders correctly
- [ ] JobMatchCard handles user interactions
- [ ] JobMatchFilter applies filters
- [ ] useJobMatches hook fetches data
- [ ] Score calculation utilities
- [ ] Date formatting utilities

**Target**: 80% code coverage
```

#### Integration Tests (30% of tests):
```markdown
**API Integration Tests**:
- [ ] GET /job-matches returns correct data structure
- [ ] POST /job-matches/refresh triggers background job
- [ ] Feedback endpoints store data correctly
- [ ] Authentication required on all endpoints
- [ ] Pagination works correctly
- [ ] Filtering and sorting work together

**Database Integration Tests**:
- [ ] JobMatch creation with relationships
- [ ] Cascade deletes work correctly
- [ ] Indexes improve query performance
- [ ] Constraints enforce data integrity

**External Service Integration**:
- [ ] OpenAI API integration (with mocks)
- [ ] Celery task execution
- [ ] Redis caching

**Target**: 70% coverage of integration points
```

#### E2E Tests (10% of tests):
```markdown
**Critical User Flows**:
1. [ ] **First-time user flow**:
   - User uploads resume
   - Matches are generated
   - User views matches
   - User saves a job
   - User applies to a job

2. [ ] **Returning user flow**:
   - User logs in
   - Sees dashboard with new matches
   - Filters matches by location
   - Provides feedback on match
   - Applies to job

3. [ ] **Error recovery flow**:
   - API timeout occurs
   - User sees error message
   - User retries successfully
   - Data is consistent

**Target**: All critical flows covered
```

## 📝 PHASE 6: Documentation

### Step 6.1: Feature Documentation
**AI Instructions**: Create comprehensive feature docs.

#### Documentation Template:
```markdown
# Job Matching Feature

## Overview
The Job Matching feature uses AI to analyze user resumes and match them with relevant job postings from our database. It provides personalized job recommendations with explanations for why each job is a good match.

## User Guide

### For End Users

#### Viewing Job Matches
1. Navigate to Dashboard
2. Click on "AI Job Matches" card
3. Browse through recommended jobs sorted by relevance
4. Click on any job to see full details

#### Filtering Matches
- **Location**: Filter by city, state, or "Remote"
- **Salary**: Set minimum salary requirement
- **Match Score**: Adjust minimum relevance threshold

#### Saving Jobs
- Click the heart icon to save jobs for later
- Access saved jobs from the "Saved Jobs" page

#### Applying to Jobs
- Click "Apply Now" to be directed to application
- Application tracked automatically in your dashboard

#### Providing Feedback
- Use 👍/👎 to rate match quality
- Feedback improves future recommendations

---

### For Developers

#### Architecture
The job matching system consists of:
- **Frontend**: React components for UI
- **API Layer**: FastAPI endpoints
- **Matching Service**: Core algorithm
- **Background Jobs**: Celery tasks for batch processing
- **Caching**: Redis for performance
- **AI**: OpenAI embeddings for semantic matching

#### API Endpoints

##### GET /api/v1/job-matches
Returns paginated list of job matches for authenticated user.

**Query Parameters**:
- `limit` (int): Number of results (max 50, default 10)
- `offset` (int): Pagination offset (default 0)
- `min_score` (float): Minimum relevance score (default 70)
- `location` (string): Filter by location
- `sort` (string): Sort by `score`, `date`, or `salary`

**Response**:
```json
{
  "matches": [/* array of matches */],
  "total": 156,
  "limit": 10,
  "offset": 0
}
```

**Error Codes**:
- `401`: Not authenticated
- `404`: No resume found for user
- `500`: Server error

##### POST /api/v1/job-matches/refresh
Triggers fresh matching analysis for user.

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "resume_id": 123,
  "preferences": {
    "locations": ["San Francisco", "Remote"],
    "min_salary": 100000
  }
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "task_id": "abc-123",
  "status": "processing",
  "estimated_time": "30s"
}
```

#### Matching Algorithm

The hybrid matching algorithm combines:

1. **Keyword Matching (40% weight)**
   - Exact skill matches
   - Synonym matching
   - Fast and explainable

2. **Semantic Similarity (40% weight)**
   - OpenAI embeddings
   - Captures context and meaning
   - Finds related opportunities

3. **Experience Matching (20% weight)**
   - Years of experience
   - Seniority level
   - Career progression

**Formula**:
```
final_score = (keyword_score × 0.4) + (semantic_score × 0.4) + (experience_score × 0.2)
```

#### Performance Considerations

- Matching runs daily at 2 AM UTC
- Results cached in Redis for 24 hours
- Manual refresh available (rate limited)
- Top 100 matches stored per user
- Top 20 matches cached for quick access

#### Monitoring

**Key Metrics**:
- Match generation time
- API response times
- User feedback (positive/negative)
- Cache hit rates
- OpenAI API usage

**Alerts**:
- Match generation failures
- OpenAI API quota exceeded
- High error rates on endpoints

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: User sees "No matches found"
**Cause**: Resume has too few skills or very specific requirements
**Solution**: 
- Encourage user to update resume with more skills
- Lower minimum score threshold
- Expand location preferences

**Issue**: Matches seem irrelevant
**Cause**: Algorithm needs tuning or resume parsing issues
**Solution**:
- Check resume parsing output
- Review algorithm weights
- Analyze user feedback patterns
- Consider A/B testing different weights

**Issue**: Slow match generation
**Cause**: Large number of active jobs or API rate limiting
**Solution**:
- Implement batching
- Add more Celery workers
- Optimize database queries
- Consider caching embeddings longer

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Company culture matching
- [ ] Salary negotiation insights
- [ ] Interview preparation suggestions
- [ ] Network connections at companies
- [ ] Job market trends and analytics
- [ ] Custom matching criteria per user
- [ ] Email notifications for new high matches
